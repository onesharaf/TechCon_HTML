A Decade of Innovation: The TechCon Story
2010: The Garage Era It started as "The Silicon Valley Code Jam"—a small meetup of 50 developers in a rented garage in Palo Alto. The goal was simple: share pizza, swap code, and build something cool over a weekend. There were no sponsors and no keynote speakers, just pure collaboration.
2015: The Rebrand As attendance hit 1,000, we officially rebranded to TechCon. We moved to our first major venue and introduced dedicated tracks for Cloud Computing and Mobile Development, recognizing that the web was changing fast. This was the year TechCon became a staple in the developer calendar.
2020: Going Global (Virtually) When the world stopped, code didn't. We hosted our first fully virtual summit, connecting 15,000+ developers from 40 different countries. It was the year we realized our community had no borders. We learned that innovation happens anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley.
2024: The Nexus Era This year marks our biggest leap forward. We are taking over the Nexus Convention Center to focus on the next frontier: Artificial Intelligence and the Human Developer. We are no longer just writing code; we are partnering with intelligence to reshape the future.

        <h2>MISSION</h2>
        <p>
            

Our Mission
To equip the global developer community with the tools, knowledge, and connections needed to shape a responsible and innovative digital future. We believe that technology is not just about writing code; it is about solving human problems at scale.
Our Vision
A world where technology is accessible, ethical, and limitless. We envision a future where the barriers to creation are removed, and every developer—regardless of background or location—has the power to build the next generation of life-changing applications.
Core Values
Innovation Over Iteration: We don’t just improve what exists; we explore what’s possible.

Open Collaboration: We believe the best code is built together. Open source is in our DNA.

Ethical Engineering: We champion technology that respects privacy, security, and human well-being.

Community First: TechCon is built by developers, for developers. Every voice matters.

Tagline Ideas (Short & Punchy)
"Empowering the architects of tomorrow."

"Code for a better world."

"Where the future gets built."

Why they are iconic: Anita’s keynote in 2015 correctly predicted the dominance of mobile-first development. Her framework for responsive design is still used by our community today.

David Chen (2018)

Role: Lead Architect, Oculus Data

Talk: "Big Data is Dead. Long Live Smart Data."

Why they are iconic: David shifted the conversation from simply collecting data to making it actionable. His live demo of a real-time analytics engine crashed our Wi-Fi but inspired a generation of data engineers.

Sarah Jenkins (2020)

Role: VP of Engineering, CloudScale

Talk: "Building Bridges While Burning the Office"

Why they are iconic: Speaking from her living room during our first virtual summit, Sarah gave the definitive talk on remote engineering culture. Her "Async-First" manifesto became the blueprint for distributed teams worldwide.

Dr. Aris Khen (2022)

Role: Chief Scientist, Aether Robotics

Talk: "When Code Walking Meets the Real World"

Why they are iconic: Aris brought a literal robot dog on stage to demonstrate the latest in edge computing. It was the moment TechCon expanded beyond pure software into the realm of hardware integration.</p>
